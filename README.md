# Cloud Translate

## What is Cloud Translate?

Cloud Translate is an interface for the
[Google Translate API](https://cloud.google.com/translate). Cloud Translate is designed
with flexibility and versatility in mind, meaning it can be utilized by a wide range of
software.

Additionally, it is made to be scalable, specifically with deployment on Amazon Web
Services in mind to facilitate seamless scalability with any increase or decrease in
demand.

## How to Run

### Running Locally

1. Set the environment variable to the contents of the API key file:

```shell
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_KEY=$(cat PATH_TO_API_KEY_FILE)
```

2. Start the server with `npm run start`
3. Access at localhost:9999

### Running as Docker Image

1. Create a docker image called 'cloud-translate-image' with `npm run docker-build`
2. Copy this `.env.example` to a new file `.env` and add contents of the API key file to
the new `.env` file after the =. Note that the API key will need to be minified and on one
line.

Run following snippet in the project root directory to add the key to the `.env` file as
required (you will need jq & vi installed):

```shell
jq -c '.' PATH_TO_API_KEY_FILE >> .env && vi -c 'normal f=v"ayd$"apJx wq' .env
```

To install jq & vi on ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install vim && sudo apt-get install jq`

3. Run this docker image with `npm run docker-run`, this command will also display the
port to access the running container on. Access via `localhost:${port}`
4. Stop the container with `npm run docker-stop`

## API

### Requesting a translation

Connect to the Cloud Translate server with a WebSocket. To request a translation use
WebSocket Send with the following format:

```javascript
{
  text: 'text to translate',
  target: 'language code for source text to be translated to'
}
```

Note that the source language does not need to be specified as it will be automatically
detected.

A list of available language codes can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/languages).

### Receiving a translation

Responses from the server can be received by the WebSocket requesting the translation with
a WebSocket message in the following format:

```javascript
{
  translation: 'text translated into target language',
  request: {
    text: 'text sent in original request',
    target: 'target language sent in original request'
    â€¦ // additional attributes
  }
}
```

### Example in JavaScript

```javascript
const webSocket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:9999')
webSocket.addEventListener('open', () => { sendTranslation() })
webSocket.addEventListener('message' () => { receiveTranslation() })

function sendTranslation() {
  webSocket.send(JSON.stringify({
    text: 'hello world',
    target: 'de'
  })
}

function receiveTranslation(event) {
  console.log(event.data);
}
```
